# Task 4 

# A motorbike costs £2000 and loses 10% of its value every year. Using a loop, print the value of the bike every following year until it falls below £1000.

motorbike_cost = 2000.00
cost = motorbike_cost
year = int(input("what is the year?"))

print("yearly depreciation of motorbike value:")

while cost >= 1000.0:
    print("year ", year, ": ", cost)
year = year + 1
cost = motorbike_cost/  10
