# Task 1 

# Write a program that does the following: 

# a) Stores a random number (1-10) in a variable – see hint below. 

# b) Asks a user for their name and stores this in a variable. 

# c) Asks a user to guess the number between 1 and 10. 

# d) Tells the user whether they have guessed correctly.

# HINT!

# You’ll need to import the random library using the following: import random 

# To generate a random number between 1 and 10, you need to use the following piece of code: random.randint(1, 10)


import random 

number = random.randint(1, 10) 

myName = input("Hello! What is your name?") 

print("Well, " + myName + "I am thinking of a number between 1 and 10.")

guess = int(input("Take a guess:") )

if user_num == number:
    
    print("Well done")

else:
    
    print("Sorry, try again")
