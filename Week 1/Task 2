# Task 2 

# Write a program that asks a user for their favourite number between 1 and 100 and then tells them a joke based on the number. You should use a minimum of 3 jokes.

user_num = int(input("What is your favourite number? Choose one between 1 and 100"))

print(user_num)

if user_num == 4 :

    print("Why didn't the number 4 go skydiving? Because he's two-squared")
    
elif user_num > 4 :

    print("Why is your favourite number 4? Because I never met a four like you.")
    
elif user_num < 4 :

    print("Did you know a ballerinaâ€™s favourite number is four! Because there's two-twoâ€™s")
    
else: 

    print("What is the solution to any equation? Multiply both sides by zero.")
