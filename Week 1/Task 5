# Task 5 
# Write a program which will ask for two numbers from a user. Then offer a menu to the user giving them a choice of operator: 

# e.g. – Enter “a” if you want to add 
# “b” if you want to subtract 
# Include +, -, /, *, ** square (to the power of). Once the user has selected which operator they wish to use, perform the calculation.

num1 = int(input("What is your first number?"))
num2 = int(input("What is the second number?"))

print(num1 + num2)

choice = (input("Choose an operation to perform \n A) add \n B) substract \n C) divide \n D) multiply \n E) to the power of"))

if choice == "A":

    print(num1 + num2)
    
elif choice == "B":

    print(num1 - num2)
    
elif choice == "C":

    print(num1 / num2)
    
elif choice == "D":

    print(num1 * num2)
    
elif choice == "E":

    print(num1 ** num2)
    
else:

    print("choice A or B or C or D or E")
