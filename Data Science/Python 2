See 'Data Science - Python 2.pdf'

# Task 2

# As an extension to the motorbike task that costs £2000 and loses 10% of its value every year. 

# Set up a function that performs the calculation by passing in parameters. 

# Then using a loop, print the value of the bike every following year until it falls below £100.

# Task 3

# Write a program which will ask for two numbers from a user.

# Then offer an option menu to the user giving them a choice of maths operators. 

# Once the user has selected which operator they wish to use, perform the calculation by using a procedure and passing parameters.
