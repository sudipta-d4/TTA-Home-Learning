Task 2

# As an extension to the motorbike task that costs £2000 and loses 10% of its value every year. 
# Set up a function that performs the calculation by passing in parameters. 
# Then using a loop, print the value of the bike every following year until it falls below £100.

motorbike_cost = 2000.00
cost = motorbike_cost
year = int(input("what is the year?"))

print("yearly depreciation of motorbike value:")

while cost >= 1000.0:
    print("year ", year, ": ", cost)
year = year + 1
cost = motorbike_cost/  10

def calculate_bike_cost():
  value_every_year = "current_value"
  loses = "What is 10% of the original value?"
  yearly = str("current_value") + "value_every_year" + "will increase by" + "loses" + "every year untill it falls below £1000"
  return yearly
