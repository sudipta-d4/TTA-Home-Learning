# TTA-Home-Learning

- An intensive 14-week course, focused on the fundamentals of data science delivered through a combination of interactive group learning and home learning tasks. 
- Completed Python fundamentals, including key data science libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, SciKit, and Tensorflow. In addition to this I gained a solid grounding in machine learning algorithms, relational database management SQL, data visualisation/business intelligence packages such as Power BI, and R programming language.
