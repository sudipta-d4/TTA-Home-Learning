# Lesson Tasks (See 'Data Science - Pandas.ipynb')

# Create a CSV file of 15 holiday destinations for a website

# 1. Add in a column of destinations

# 2. Add in a column that shows feedback score out of 10 for that destination

# 3. Add in a column for average hotel star rating for those destinations 

# 4. Add in a column for number of all-inclusive hotels within each destination

# 5. Add in the most visited city in each destination

# Task 1 (See 'Data Science - Pandas.ipynb')

# 1. How many rows and columns are there in your file?

# 2. Print row 3-8 ( using iloc/loc).

# 3. Find the mean number of all-inclusive hotels across all destinations.

# 4. Find the lowest scoring destination.

# 5. Find the highest scoring destination.

# 6. Find all the destinations where there are more than 9 all-inclusive hotels.

# 7. Filter the data by score above 8.

# 8. Filter the data score below 2 ( I need to know if these destinations should be removed or there is a problem).

# Extension Task (See 'Data Science - Pandas.ipynb')

# 1. Is there a correlation between number of all-inclusive hotels and score?

# 2. Create a data visualisation diagram to show destination and highest scores?
