# Compulsory 

# Imagine the following scenario: You are a data analyst at an organisation. You have been given a data set and asked to create a meaningful data visualisation 
# using this data. Using the ggplotin-built data sets in RStudio and the qplot function, get your creative juices flowing and create a meaningful and impactful 
# data visualization using your preferred data set.

# 1.	Write an R program to create three vectors a, b, c with 5 integers. Combine the three vectors to become a 3Ã—5 matrix where each column represents a vector. Print the content of the matrix. Plot a graph and label correctly.
# 2.	Write a R program to create a Data frame which contain details of 5 employees and display the details.  (Name, Age, Role and Length of service).
# 3.	Import the GGPLOT 2 library and plot a graph using the qplot function.  X axis is the sequence of 1:20 and the y axis is the x ^ 2. Label the graph appropriately. install.packages("ggplot2", dependencies = TRUE)
# 4.	Create a simple bar plot of five subjects

# Additional

# 1.	Write a R program to take input from the user (name and age) and display the values.
# 2.	Write a R program to create a sequence of numbers from 20 to 50 and find the mean of numbers from 20 to 50 and sum of numbers.7.
# 3.	Write a R program to create a vector which contains 10 random integer values between -50 and +50

# Optional
# 1.	Write a R program to get the first 10 Fibonacci numbers
# 2.	Write a R program to print the numbers from 1 to 100 and print "Fizz" for multiples of 3, print "Buzz" for multiples of 5, and print "FizzBuzz" for multiples of both.
