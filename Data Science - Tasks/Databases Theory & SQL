# Task 1 - (See 'Data Science - MySQL')

# Create a relational database (2 tables) of your own choice. It must be a meaningful/thought out database.
# Both tables must have a primary key and the correct datatypes. Include a minimum of 5 fields in at least one of the tables.
# View and show both table structures and data to make sure they are setup correctly.
# Enter records into both tables and view them. Make sure at least one of your tables has 10 records. Update a record
# Delete a record
# Join tables
# Run a simple query (one field/column) searching one table.
# Run a complex query (more than one field/column) to demonstrate the relations between the 2 tables
# Retrieve all your data sorted in ascending order on an appropriate field (one table)
# Filter data using comparison operators (one table)
