# Task 1

# Write a program that does the following: 

# a) Stores a random number (1-10) in a variable – see hint below. 

# b) Asks a user for their name and stores this in a variable. 

# c) Asks a user to guess the number between 1 and 10. 

# d) Tells the user whether they have guessed correctly.

# HINT!

# You’ll need to import the random library using the following: import random 

# To generate a random number between 1 and 10, you need to use the following piece of code: random.randint(1, 10)

# Task 2

# Write a program that asks a user for their favourite number between 1 and 100 and then tells them a joke based on the number.

# You should use a minimum of 3 jokes.

# Task 3

# Write a program that allows user to enter their favourite starter, main course, dessert and drink. 

# Concatenate these and output a message which says – “Your favourite meal is ………with a glass of….”

# Task 4

# A motorbike costs £2000 and loses 10% of its value every year. 

# Using a loop, print the value of the bike every following year until it falls below £1000.

# Task 5

# Write a program which will ask for two numbers from a user. Then offer a menu to the user giving them a choice of operator: 

# e.g. – Enter “a” if you want to add 

# “b” if you want to subtract 

# Include +, -, /, *, ** square (to the power of). 

# Once the user has selected which operator they wish to use, perform the calculation.
