# Task 1 (See 'Data Science - Deep Learning (TF) & AI Ethics.pdf')

# Practical: Artificial Intelligence (AI) 

# In Data Science we process a lot data through AI. With the GDPR, it is becoming increasingly important to understand the ethics behind the data that is collected, 
# stored, processed and evaluated.

# •	What should organisations do to ensure that they are being responsible with AI and the wider use of data in general?

# •	Maximum 500 words.

# Task 2

# Optional Home Learning Task

# 1.	Use the below website to practice. This uses the online. 

# 2.	https://machinelearningmastery.com/tensorflow-tutorialdeep-learning-with-tf-keras/ 

# 3.	The explanation and code is in there and you can use the copy function to help. 

# 4.	The steps and code are very similar – you should start to notice the similarities yourselves. 

# 5.	This page features multiple neural network tutorials – if you chose to do this optional task, you only need to pick one of these.
