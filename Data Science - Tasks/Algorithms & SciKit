# Task 1 (See 'Data Science – Algorithms (Machine Learning.pdf'))

# Select one or more choices from the list of common Machine Learning Algorithms, do some investigations and write me a short summary. 

# I am looking for the following:

# Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, SVM (Support Vector Machine), Naive Bayes, KNN (K- Nearest Neighbours), K-Means and Random Forest

# •	Is it Supervised/Unsupervised/Reinforcement learning?

# •	What does the algorithm do?

# •	In which situations will it be most useful? 

# •	(Optional) Can you find any examples of where this algorithm has been used?

# Task 2
