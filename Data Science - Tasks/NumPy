# Task 1 (See 'Data Science - NumPy.ipynb' 

# 1. Create a 1D array of numbers from 0-9

# 2. Create a 3Ã—3 NumPy array of allBoolean value Trues

# 3. Extract all odd numbers from array of 1-10

# 4. Replace all odd numbers in an array of 1-10 with the value 

# 5. Convert a 1D array to a 2D array with 2rows

# 6. Create two arrays a and b, stack these two arrays vertically use the  np.dot and np.sum to calculate totals

# Extension Task (See 'Data Science - NumPy.ipynb' 

# Task 1

# Create the following pattern without hardcoding. Use only NumPy  functions.
#>array([1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3])

# Task 2 

# In two arrays a ( 1,2,3,4,5) and b ( 4,5,6,7,8,9)
# remove all repeating items present in array b

# Task 3 

# Get all items between 3 and 7 from a and b and sum them together
